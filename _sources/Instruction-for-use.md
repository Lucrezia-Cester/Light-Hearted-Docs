## Device Purpose
The device needs to acquire heart valve sounds and has been designed, manufactured and packaged to do so. Tests have been carried out in bech mark clinical trials to make sure the device is fit for purpose. The device purpose falls under the directive of Article 2.a. of the COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/42/EEC
of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices because its inteded use is for diagnosis of diseases in humans.


## Side Effects
If the laser is pointed in the eye of the patient for a prolonged period of time, damage to the eye may occur. The device should only be used for its intended purpose and according to specifications.

Undesirable side effects might incur if the device is not used for its indended purpose, more information about this can be found in the "device labes" document, in the sections "handling conditions", "operating instructions" and "warnings" where it is outlined what are the risks of not using the device according to its indended use. 


## Installation Instructions
The device needs to be connected to the computer. The laser needs to be turned on via the switch.
The device is now ready to use. 

Please refer to the document "device labels" for a full set of instructions on how to use the device for its inteded purpose.

## Re-use Instructions
The device is reusable. Since it does not come in contact with the patient or touched, the switch just needs to be cleaned with a wipe when deemed necessary as this is the only part 
of the device whihc will be routinely touched.

## Demage to the device
If the device is not handled with care as specified in the document "device labels" under the section "Handling conditions", the device might get damaged. 
There are various scenarious which might occur:
1. The circuit that connects the laser to the power supply tears away. In this case, while following the instructions in the document "device labels" under the section "Operating Instructions" step 6.1, the software will show that the device is not turned on. In this case the manufacturer must be called to fix the device, until then the device cannot be used.
2. The objective in front of the device is moved with respect to the camera thus it cannot focus light into the camera chip. If this happens while following the instructions in the document "device labels" under the section "Operating Instructions" step 6.5, the software will show that the data has not been acquired successfully and will show that the reflected light acquired by the camera does not match the required specifications as outlined in section 6.5. In this case the manufacturer must be called to fix the device, until then the device cannot be used.
3. Clinicians should calibrate the device and perdorm QA on the device once a day to ensure the device is working according to specifications. The instructions to permorm QA are laid out in this document in the section "Demage to the device".
